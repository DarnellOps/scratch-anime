                I really love anime. My first experience with anime were on Saturday mornings with Kids' WB on channel
                39
                and Fox Kids on channel 26 in Houston back in the late 90s and early 2000s. The shows I liked watching
                were
                Pokemon, YuGiOh, Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura and more. I didn't know they were considered anime until
                much later. I thought they were your typical American cartoon that every kid liked waking up early to
                watch.
                I had no idea they were made in Japan and were then dubbed for American audiences. As I grew older, I
                learned that most anime are adaptations of Japanese comics called manga. The biggest of which is called
                Shonen Jump where some of the most popular series originated.

                Since watching many different anime over the years, I think I've found my top 3 favorite anime. My Hero
                Academia, Naruto, and Dragon Ball Z. These are by no means what I consider masterpieces, I can make
                another
                post about that, these are just what I enjoy immensely while watching. I just get into such a good mood
                when
                I get to sit down I watch them. I'll give each there own page.
