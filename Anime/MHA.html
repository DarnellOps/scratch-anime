                As of now, My Hero Academia is my favorite anime of all time. I love it. I don't know, something
                about
                having powers has always resonated with me. Watching the protagonist Izuku Midoriya, transform from
                this
                timid little boy to powerhouse UA student is so enjoyable. I love everything about MHA, there isn't
                anything in it I dislike. I like all the students, I want them all to succeed.

                I watched the first season because I saw positive sentiment on the internet. It's an action shonen anime
                which is right up my alley. I wasn't crazy about it but I enjoyed the first season, it was interesting.
                But the second season is what got me hooked on the show, from there, the show got better and better. I
                started to care for the characters, cheering them on, wanting them to achieve their goals. I wanted to
                be there with them, that's how much I like the characters.
