                My first memory of Dragon Ball Z was at my baby sitter's house when Goku was aiming an energy attack at
                Supreme
                Kai. I was around 6 or 7 when I saw that. At the time, I didn't know anything about the show but what I
                saw, I thought was cool.
            </p>

            <p>Dragon Ball follows the life of Goku who was sent to Earth by his mother and father, Gine and Bardock, to
                escape the destruction of their home planet, Planet Vegeta, by the hands of the tyrant Frieza. Over the
                years, he makes a lot of friends and enemies both on and off planet Earth. </p>

            <p>
                The big part of why I like DBZ so much are the fights and transformations. Seeing their hair turn gold
                and seeing the ground crumble around them as their power rose gave me goosebumps. My favorite
                transformation ever is seeing a very young Gohan finally snap an unleashing his power to fight Cell.
                Although he was a machine, seeing a gentle giant taken out right in front of him and seeing his friends
                get beatdown by the Cell Jrs was enough to set Gohan
                off in a whirlwind of power.

            <p>
                After the smoke clears, you get a glimpse of a different Gohan, a more angry and brutal Gohan. One of
                the other aspects of the show that enjoy is the fighting. Seeing people launch energy beams at each
                other and get sent flying through buildings gets my blood pumping everytime. It's so damn cool!
            </p>

            <p>
                I like Dragon Ball so much that I bought the manga for DBZ and own the dvds/blurays for the entire
                series, from Dragon Ball up to Dragon Ball GT, excluding Dragon Ball Super, although I do own the DBS
                Broly movie.
